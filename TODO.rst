CUMIN TODO
##########

Tracking ideas to improve Cumin. They are in no particular order inside each section and there is no guarantee that
any item listed will be implemented in the nearby future.

On the masters
==============

Internal improvements / bug fixes
---------------------------------

* CLI: fix progress bar interaction with ctrl+c and ``sigint_handler()``.
* CLI: suppress normal output when ``-o/--output`` is used.
* clustershell transport: decouple the output handling from the event handlers.
* clustershell transport: improve test coverage for partial/total failures and timeouts.
* clustershell transport: improve and extend integration tests.

Small improvements
------------------

* global: allow to log the whole output to a specific file, to allow multiple people follow the progress.
* global: allow to randomize the list hosts before execution `T164587`_.
* CLI: improve the dry-run mode to show what would have been done.
* CLI: read commands from a file, one per line.
* CLI: add ``--limit`` to randomly select N hosts within a broader selection.
* puppetdb backend: improve globbing support, check if fnmatch could be used without conflicting with ClusterShell
  NodeSet.
* puppetdb backend: allow to specify boolean values for resource parameters `T161545`_.

New Features
------------

* global: connection timeout/failure should be treated differently than normal failures:

  * don't consider them for the success threshold by default, add a ``--fail-always`` option for that
  * if the first command executed on a host fails with exit code 255, try to run ``/bin/true``, if it fails too it
    should be considered a connection timeout/failure

* global: allow to notify the user who launched the execution on failure/termination trough IRC/email. Useful for long
  running jobs.
* global: allow to differentiate the command to execute on a per-host basis, i.e. passing a different parameter for
  each host.
* global: allow to have an external audit log and/or announce commands execution on IRC.
* transports: add an output-only transport to nicely print the matching hosts and some related count.
* transports: allow to specify a rollback strategy to be executed in each host on failure.
* transports: add parallel execution of local commands on the master for each targeted host with the host as a
  parameter. Needs a new local transport with ExecWorker to shell out in parallel.
* backends: generalize backends to allow to return other data too, not only the host certnames.
* backends: add a new backend to support conftool.
* puppetdb backend: add support for API v4.
* CLI: when ``-i/--interactive`` is used and no command or query is specified, drop into a REPL session allowing to
  easily setup them.

On the targets
==============

Future plans
------------

* Create a single entry point to allow the execution of idempotent modules.
* Create a safe and reliable sync up mechanism for the modules.
* Allow to handle timeouts and failures locally within the module (local rollback and/or cleanup).
* Allow to drop privileges into a different user.
